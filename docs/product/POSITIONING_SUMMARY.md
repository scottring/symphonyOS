# Positioning Summary: How Everything Fits Together

*Quick reference showing how Symphony's key concepts work together*

---

## The Core Value Proposition

**Problem:** You capture information (links, phone numbers, notes), but it never surfaces when you need it. You spend minutes hunting across apps.

**Solution:** Symphony makes context first-class. Attach everything during planning. It surfaces automatically during execution.

**Outcome:** Set it up once → Surfaces every time.

---

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Context-Linking (What Makes Us Different)

Tasks and projects are **rich containers**, not just titles:

```
Task: "Order kitchen backsplash"
├─ Link: https://tilesupplier.com/arctic-white-subway
├─ Phone: (555) 123-4567 (ABC Tile Supply)
├─ Notes: "3x6 size, Arctic White, 45 sq ft needed"
└─ Photo: kitchen.jpg (future)

Project: "Kitchen Remodel"
├─ Link: https://contractor-website.com
├─ Phone: (555) 987-6543 (Bob Johnson, contractor)
└─ Notes: "Quote approved $8,500, starts March 15"
    └─ Tasks inherit project context
```

**When you need to act:**
- Tap "Order kitchen backsplash"
- See: Product link, supplier phone, your notes, project contractor info
- Execute in 30 seconds, no searching

This is **context surfacing** — the information you need appears when you need it.

### 2. Three Domains (Work, Personal, Family)

Your life happens in three contexts. Symphony treats all three equally.

| Domain | Purpose | Privacy | Examples |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Work** | Professional life | Private | Client calls, project deadlines, code reviews |
| **Personal** | Individual goals | Private | Health goals, hobbies, learning, self-care |
| **Family** | Shared household | Shared | Kids' schedules, home projects, errands |

**Domain separation means:**
- Filter by domain: See only work during work hours
- Privacy controls: Work/personal never visible to family
- Equal importance: Not a "family app with work bolted on"

**Current implementation:**
```typescript
type TaskContext = 'work' | 'family' | 'personal'

// Tasks tagged with context
task.context = 'work'     // Private to you
task.context = 'personal' // Private to you
task.context = 'family'   // Visible to household
```

**Future evolution (V2):**
- Domains become full containers with separate views
- Time-based filtering (only work tasks during work hours)
- Location-based surfacing (home tasks when you're home)

---

### 3. Individual + Sharing (Architecture Model)

**Built for individuals, designed for sharing.**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         User (Primary Unit)         │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Work Domain (Private)               │
│  ├─ Projects                        │
│  ├─ Tasks                           │
│  └─ Calendar events                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Personal Domain (Private)           │
│  ├─ Projects                        │
│  ├─ Tasks                           │
│  └─ Goals                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Family Domain (Shared)              │
│  ├─ Shared projects                 │
│  ├─ Assigned tasks                  │
│  └─ Shared calendar                 │
│     ↕                                │
│  [Household Members Can See]        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**This means:**
- You are the primary user, not your family
- Each person has their own account, inbox, planning sessions
- Private data (work/personal) stays private
- Family data sharing is robust and first-class
- Think: "Personal OS with multiplayer mode"

**NOT:**
- "Family app with private folders"
- "Team tool trying to work for individuals"
- "All-or-nothing sharing"

**Household sharing:**
```typescript
// User belongs to household (optional)
household_members
  ├─ Scott (owner)
  ├─ Iris (member)
  └─ Can see each other's 'family' context tasks

// Privacy preserved
task.context = 'work'     → Only Scott sees it
task.context = 'personal' → Only Scott sees it
task.context = 'family'   → Both Scott and Iris see it

// Assignments flow
Scott creates task → Assigns to Iris → Iris sees in her view
```

## How They Work Together: User Journey

### **Planning (Desktop - Sunday morning)**

Scott opens Symphony on his laptop:

1. **Brain dump** → Tasks go to inbox
2. **Triage inbox:**
   - "Client presentation deck" → Work domain, schedule for Tuesday
   - "Research hiking backpacks" → Personal domain, someday list
   - "Order new kitchen faucet" → Family domain, schedule for Wednesday
3. **Add context to family task:**
   - Task: "Order kitchen faucet"
   - Domain: Family
   - Link: https://homedepot.com/delta-faucet
   - Phone: (555) HOME-DEPOT
   - Notes: "Model #AB-1234, brushed nickel, 3-hole mount"
   - Assign to: Iris
4. **Sunday sync with Iris:**
   - Review family domain together
   - Iris sees "Order kitchen faucet" with full context
   - They discuss, Iris agrees to handle it

### **Execution (Mobile - Wednesday afternoon)**

Iris opens Symphony on her phone:

1. **Today view** shows her cards:
   - Work tasks (private - Scott can't see these)
   - "Order kitchen faucet" (assigned by Scott)
2. **Taps "Order kitchen faucet"** → Detail panel opens:
   - See the product link Scott attached
   - See Home Depot phone number
   - See notes: "Model #AB-1234, brushed nickel, 3-hole mount"
3. **Acts immediately:**
   - Tap link → Opens product page in browser
   - Tap phone → Calls Home Depot
   - Places order in 2 minutes
4. **Marks done** → Scott sees it completed in his view

**No searching. No "where did Scott put that info?" Context surfaces automatically.**

## Technical Architecture

### Data Model (Current State)

```sql
-- Users (auth.users) - one per person
-- Households - optional sharing container
-- Household_members - links users to households

-- Tasks
tasks
  ├─ user_id (owner)
  ├─ title
  ├─ context ('work' | 'family' | 'personal')
  ├─ notes (rich context)
  ├─ links (jsonb array)
  ├─ phone_number
  ├─ project_id (optional)
  ├─ assigned_to (optional - family member)
  └─ scheduled_for (when to do it)

-- Projects (context containers)
projects
  ├─ user_id (owner)
  ├─ name
  ├─ status
  ├─ notes (rich context)
  ├─ links (jsonb array)
  └─ phone_number
```

### RLS Policies (Privacy Model)

```sql
-- Work/Personal tasks: Only you see them
SELECT * FROM tasks
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  AND context IN ('work', 'personal')

-- Family tasks: Your household sees them
SELECT * FROM tasks
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  OR (
    context = 'family'
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM household_members
      WHERE household_id = tasks.household_id
      AND user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  )
```

## Competitive Differentiation

| Competitor | Their Approach | Symphony Difference |
|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Todoist** | Personal task manager | ✅ Rich context (links/phones/notes)<br>✅ Domain separation<br>✅ Family sharing |
| **Asana** | Team project management | ✅ Personal-first (not team-first)<br>✅ Mobile execution focus<br>✅ Life domains |
| **Cozi** | Family organizer | ✅ Work/personal domains<br>✅ Rich context surfacing<br>✅ Individual users, not family account |
| **Things 3** | Personal productivity | ✅ Family sharing<br>✅ Context surfacing<br>✅ Cross-platform |
| **Notion** | Knowledge workspace | ✅ Execution-focused (not reference)<br>✅ Automatic surfacing<br>✅ Mobile-first execution |

**Symphony is the only tool that combines:**
1. Rich context (links, phones, notes) that surfaces automatically
2. Three equal domains (work, personal, family)
3. Individual-first with robust multiplayer
4. Plan on desktop, execute on mobile

## Key Messaging

**For pitches:**
> "Symphony is your personal OS for work, life, and family. The key insight: captured information doesn't surface when you need it. We make context first-class — attach links, phone numbers, notes during planning, they surface automatically during execution."

**For demos:**
> "Let me show you the problem Symphony solves. You research a product, save the link somewhere, jot down notes. Two weeks later when it's time to buy, you spend 10 minutes hunting. Symphony fixes this. Set it up once, surfaces every time."

**For differentiation:**
> "Most apps are work tools or family tools. Symphony treats work, personal, and family equally. Your work stays private. Your family sharing is robust. You're the primary user."

**For skeptics:**
> "It looks like a to-do app, but it's fundamentally different. Traditional apps store tasks. Symphony stores context. The task is just the handle. The value is in what surfaces with it."
