## The Three Core Messages

### 1. **Life is Collaborative**
Symphony connects tasks to people — family, contractors, doctors, coworkers.
→ Everyone knows what they're responsible for.

### 2. **Context is First-Class**
Phone numbers, links, notes, measurements attach to tasks.
→ Everything you need surfaces when you need it.

### 3. **Right Information, Right Time**
Plan deeply on desktop. Symphony brings it forward on mobile.
→ Set it up once, surfaces every time.
