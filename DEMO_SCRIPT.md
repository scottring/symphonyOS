## Demo Flow (5 Minutes)

### 0:00-0:30 | The Moment (30 seconds)

**Screen:** Show typical scattered tools (optional slide or just talk)

**Script:**
> "Picture this: It's 2pm on Wednesday. You're ready to order tile for your kitchen remodel. You open Symphony and there it is — the task with the product link, the contractor's number, your measurements, everything you need. One tap to call, one tap to order. Done in 30 seconds.
>
> That's what Symphony does. You plan deeply when you have time to think. Symphony brings everything forward when it's time to act. Let me show you how it works."

---

### 0:30-1:00 | What Symphony Does (30 seconds)

**Screen:** Symphony Today view (desktop)

**Script:**
> "Symphony is your personal operating system for life. It does three things beautifully:
>
> First, it connects your tasks to people — family members, contractors, doctors — because life is collaborative.
>
> Second, it makes context first-class — phone numbers, links, notes, measurements attach to tasks and surface when you need them.
>
> Third, it works how you actually live — plan deeply on desktop, execute effortlessly on mobile. Three domains: Work, Personal, and Family — all equally important."

> [Click tag] What domain? Family — this is about my daughter.
>
> [Click person] Who is this about? Dr. Sarah Chen. Notice: this isn't WHO should do it, it's who the task is ABOUT. I'm still doing this task, but it's connected to Dr. Chen.

>
> [Point to task notes] My specific notes: 45 square feet needed.
>
> [Point to project section] But the task also shows its project context — the contractor's number, the supplier website, the tile specs. I set this up once during planning. Now when it's 2pm and time to order, I don't search for anything. One tap and I'm ready to execute."

#### 3:15-4:00 | Mobile Execution (45 seconds)

**Screen:** Back to desktop, show domain filter or color-coded tasks

   - Family tasks (with family icon/color)
   - Personal tasks (with personal icon/color)
2. Optionally filter by one domain to show separation

**Script:**
> "Notice the domains throughout. Work tasks stay private — my client projects, deadlines. Family is shared with my partner — household tasks, kids' schedules. Personal is mine — hobbies, health, learning.
>
> Symphony treats all three as first-class. It's not a 'family app' with work bolted on. It's not a 'productivity app' that forgets you have a family. All three matter equally."

---

### 4:30-5:00 | The Vision (30 seconds)

**Screen:** Stay on Today view showing the daily plan

**Script:**
> "Here's what makes Symphony different: Context is first-class. You attach links, phone numbers, notes, files to your tasks and projects during planning. Symphony surfaces it all when you need it.
>
> Three domains — work, personal, family — all equally important.
>
> Built for individuals with robust sharing. You're the primary unit, not your family. Your data is yours.
>
> Plan deeply on desktop when you have time to think. Execute effortlessly on mobile when life happens.
>
> That's Symphony: Your personal operating system for life."

   - "Not a family app. Not a work app. All of life."

3. **Desktop vs Mobile**
   - "Plan deeply on desktop"
   - "Execute effortlessly on mobile"
   - "This is the rhythm"

4. **Individual First**
   - "You are the primary unit, not your family"
   - "Your work stays private, your family sharing is robust"

5. **Simple Capture, Rich Planning**
   - "Brain dump is just a title"

## Demo Tips

### Pacing
- **0:00-1:00** — Set up the problem and promise (talk fast, build energy)
- **1:00-4:00** — Show features (slow down, let UI breathe, less talking)
- **4:00-5:00** — Vision and close (confident, clear, memorable)

### Visual Flow
- Start desktop (shows power and planning)
- Switch to mobile (shows execution simplicity)
- End desktop (shows the full system)

### Interaction Style
- **Don't narrate every click** — Let the UI speak for itself
- **Do explain the why** — "Notice how the project context appears automatically"
- **Do show real scenarios** — Use realistic task names and context

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Spending too long on any one feature
2. Talking while clicking (pause after click, let them see, then explain)
3. Apologizing for incomplete features
4. Getting lost in technical details
5. Forgetting to show mobile view

## Post-Demo Questions to Expect

**Q: "Can I share tasks with my spouse?"**
A: "Yes! Family domain tasks are shared with everyone in your household. Each person sees the same tasks and can mark them complete. Work and personal domains stay private."

**Q: "Does this replace my calendar?"**
A: "No, Google Calendar is your source of truth. Symphony reads from your calendar and shows events alongside tasks. We don't replace your calendar — we enhance it with tasks and context."

**Q: "What about recurring tasks?"**
A: "Routines are coming in V1.6. Right now you can manually reschedule recurring items, but automated recurrence is on the roadmap."

**Q: "Is this available now?"**
A: "We're in active development. V1.5 is live with the core features you just saw. We're adding more capabilities every sprint."

**Q: "How much does it cost?"**
A: "We're currently in private beta — free while we refine the experience with early users."
