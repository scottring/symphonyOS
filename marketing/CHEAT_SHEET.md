# Symphony OS: One-Page Marketing Cheat Sheet

*Quick reference for consistent messaging*

---

## 🎯 The 10-Second Pitch
"Symphony OS is your family's operating system. Everything you need to do, everyone you're coordinating with, all in one place that actually helps you get things done."

---

## ⭐ The Three Differentiators

### 1. Timeline Companion 🗺️
**What:** Subway-map view of your family's day
**Why it matters:** See conflicts before chaos, visual coordination at a glance
**Sound bite:** "Everyone's a line. Lines converge at shared moments, diverge for individual time."

### 2. Context-First Execution 📋
**What:** Every task surfaces with phone numbers, notes, links, contacts attached
**Why it matters:** No searching when it's time to do something
**Sound bite:** "Everything you need, right when you need it. No searching."

### 3. Desktop + Mobile Philosophy 💻📱
**What:** Deep planning on desktop, quick execution on mobile
**Why it matters:** Right tool for the right task
**Sound bite:** "Plan deeply, execute quickly. One system, zero friction."

## 🎨 Brand Voice

**We are:** Confident, clear, warm, honest
**We're not:** Corporate, pushy, clever, apologetic

**Do say:**
- "Your family's command center"
- "See conflicts before chaos"
- "Context when you need it"
- "Less chaos. More life."

**Don't say:**
- "Revolutionary" / "Game-changing"
- "The best" / "The only"
- "Easy" (be honest about setup time)
- "Productivity platform" (too corporate)

## 👥 Personas & Pain Points

### The Mental Load Bearer (Primary)
**Pain:** "I'm the only one who remembers everything"
**Solution:** Fair assignment visibility + context attachments
**Hook:** "Stop being the family database"

### The Busy Professional Parent
**Pain:** "I need systems that work, not more apps"
**Solution:** Desktop planning + mobile execution
**Hook:** "Plan once, execute everywhere"

### The Collaborative Partner
**Pain:** "I want to help but don't know what needs doing"
**Solution:** Clear assignments + timeline view
**Hook:** "See what's assigned to you, context included"

---

## 📊 Competitive Positioning

**vs. Notion:** "Purpose-built for families, not databases you have to configure"
**vs. Todoist:** "Family coordination, not just personal tasks"
**vs. Google Stack:** "Unified system instead of juggling 5 apps"

**Unique combo:** Visual coordination (Timeline) + Rich context + AI + Desktop+Mobile

## 🎬 Social Media Snippets

### Twitter/X (280 chars)
"Managing family life is chaos.

Symphony OS: Your family's operating system
• Timeline Companion - see your day like a subway map  
• Context-first tasks - no more searching
• AI meal planning
• Desktop + mobile

Beta: [link]"

### LinkedIn (1200 chars)
"After 13 years in B2B SaaS, I rebuilt my family coordination system from scratch.

The problem: American families waste 6 hrs/week searching for information, resolving conflicts, managing mental load. That's a $47B problem.

Symphony OS is different:
1. Timeline Companion - subway-map view shows family coordination at a glance
2. Context attachments - phone numbers, links, notes surface when needed
3. AI meal planning - prompt → full week plan + grocery list
4. Desktop + mobile - plan deeply on desktop, execute on phone

Unlike Cozi (too simple) or Notion (too complex), Symphony is built for execution, not just capture.

Launching to 50 beta families this month. Lifetime founder pricing for early adopters.
