## PART 1: The Problem (90 seconds)

**[Screen: Blank/neutral slide or desktop]**

"Let me show you a typical Monday morning in my house..."

**[Open multiple tabs/apps chaotically]**
- Google Calendar
- Apple Notes with scattered task lists
- Text thread searching for a phone number
- Email searching for a link someone sent

"Sound familiar? The information exists somewhere. The problem is FINDING it when you need it."

"Tasks in one place, contacts in another, that important link buried in texts... and you're the only one who knows where it all is."

**[Close all tabs]**

"What if everything surfaced exactly when you needed it?"

---

## PART 2: First Impression (60 seconds)

**[Open Symphony OS - Home/Today view]**

*Pause for 3 seconds—let the calm, clean interface land*

"This is Symphony OS. Your family's operating system."

**[Gesture to interface sections]**

"Here's what you see when you open it:"
- "Today's tasks—with context attached"
- "Calendar events from Google"
- "Routines that need doing"
- "Everything in one place, organized by when it matters"

"Notice what you DON'T see: No overwhelming lists. No notification badges. Just what's relevant right now."

---

## PART 3: Core Demo Flow (7-9 minutes)

### 3.1: Context Attachments - The Key Differentiator (3 minutes)

**[Click on a task: "Call dentist about Ella's appointment"]**

**[Detail panel opens showing:**
- Phone number with tap-to-call
- Notes: "Ask about whitening options, verify insurance"
- Link to dentist website
- Contact card for dentist
- Prep task (checked): "Find insurance card"]

*Pause to let this sink in*

"This is the difference. When I created this task last week, I attached everything I'd need."

**[Point to each element]**

"Phone number—one tap to call. I don't need to search my contacts.

Notes—my questions are right here. I'm not trying to remember what I wanted to ask.

Link—their website if I need to check hours. Already here.

Contact—all the dentist's info in one place.

Prep task—I already handled finding the insurance card. That's checked off."

**[Close panel, show another task with different context types]**

"Every task can have this kind of context. When it's time to do something, you're ready. No searching through old texts, no 'where did I put that link?', no asking your partner for the phone number."

**[Create a new task live]**
"Let me show you how quick this is."

**[Press Cmd+K]**
"Command-K for quick capture."

**[Type: "Schedule car maintenance"]**
**[Add context:]**
- Phone number: (555) 987-6543
- Note: "Mention the weird noise when turning left"
- Schedule for: Next Tuesday 9am]

"Done. When Tuesday morning comes, I'll see this with everything I need. The phone number, my note about the noise. Ready to execute."

---

### 3.2: Planning Mode (2 minutes)

**[Click Planning Mode or show planning view]**

"This is where Symphony really shines for weekly planning."

**[Show drag-drop interface with calendar grid]**

"Sunday evening, I sit down with coffee and plan my week."

**[Point to unscheduled task drawer at bottom]**
"These are tasks that aren't scheduled yet."

**[Drag a task onto calendar]**
"Drag onto a time slot..."

**[Task snaps into place]**
"And it's scheduled. The system knows when this needs to happen now."

**[Show conflict detection]**
"See this? I already have a meeting at that time. Symphony shows the conflict immediately."

**[Drag to resolve]**
"Move it to a free slot. Conflict resolved."

**[Resize a task]**
"Drag the edges to set duration. This meeting is 30 minutes."

"This is desktop power. Visual, intuitive, and it catches conflicts before they become chaos."

---

### 3.3: Linked Tasks (90 seconds)

**[Select a routine: "School morning routine"]**

**[Show linked prep tasks]**
"Routines can have prep tasks that surface the night before."

**[Point to prep tasks:]**
- "Pack lunches" (night before)
- "Lay out clothes" (night before)
- "Check backpacks" (night before)

"These automatically show up the evening before. So when morning hits, you're ready."

**[Show followup tasks option]**
"You can also add followup tasks. Like 'Email teacher about field trip form' after the morning routine."

**[Demonstrate creating a linked prep task]**
"Add new prep task for tomorrow's dentist appointment..."

**[Type: "Find Ella's insurance card"]**
**[Shows it linking to the dentist task]**

"Now tomorrow when I see 'Call dentist', the prep work is already listed. If it's not done, I know before I make the call."

---

### 3.4: Family Coordination (2 minutes)

**[Show Today view with multiple family members' items]**

"Symphony is built for family coordination."

**[Point to color-coded assignments]**
- "Blue items: assigned to me"
- "Purple: assigned to Iris"
- "Green: assigned to Ella"

**[Click on a routine]**
"This morning routine alternates. Today it's my turn."

**[Show routine assignment]**
"See? 'Assigned to: Scott' for today. Tomorrow it's Iris's turn."

**[Show task with shared assignment]**
"Some tasks are shared. 'Shop for groceries'—both of us can see it, whoever gets to it first can mark it done."

**[Point to assignment interface]**
"Easy to assign, easy to see who's doing what. No more 'I thought you were handling that.'"

---

### 3.5: Projects (90 seconds)

**[Navigate to Projects view]**

"For bigger goals, we have projects."

**[Click on "Plan Summer Vacation" project]**

### 3.6: Desktop + Mobile (90 seconds)

**[Split screen or switch between desktop and mobile]**

**[Desktop side]**
"Desktop is where I plan. Sunday evening:"
- Drag tasks onto calendar
- Add context (links, numbers, notes)
- Assign routines to family
- Set up the week

**[Mobile side]**
"Mobile is where I execute. Throughout the week:"
- Quick capture (anything comes to mind)
- See what's now/next with all context
- Swipe to complete
- Check things off

"Plan deeply once. Execute quickly all week."

---

## PART 4: What This Actually Means (90 seconds)

**[Return to Today view]**

"So what does this solve?"

**[Point to different areas]**

"**Stop being the family database.**
The phone number is attached to the task. The link is there. Your partner doesn't need to ask you where stuff is."

**[Point to planning mode]**
"**See conflicts before they're problems.**
Planning mode shows you Thursday's chaos on Sunday, when you can still do something about it."

**[Point to context panel]**
"**No more searching.**
That thing you need? It's attached. Right here. When it's time."

**[Point to assignments]**
"**Fair visibility.**
You can see who's doing what. No invisible labor. No arguments about balance."

**[Pause]**

"Symphony doesn't eliminate work. But it eliminates the chaos around getting work done."

---

## PART 5: Coming Soon - Preview (2 minutes)

**[Show Timeline Companion prototype/mockup]**

"We're working on something I'm really excited about. Timeline Companion."

**[Show subway-map visualization]**
"Think of it like a subway map for your family's day."

**[Point to features]**
- "Each person is a line"
- "Lines converge at shared moments—dinner, pickup, events"
- "Lines diverge for individual time—work, school, activities"
- "Moving dots show where everyone is"
- "Conflicts glow before they become chaos"

**[Show example scenario]**
"Like here: Both parents have meetings during school pickup time. Symphony spots this visually."

**[Zoom out]**
"This isn't finished yet, but beta testers will get early preview access."

"The foundation is there—the data, the sync, the coordination. We're just building the visualization."

---

## PART 6: Beta Honest Talk (90 seconds)

- Lifetime founder pricing (60% off forever)
- Direct access to me
- Early Timeline preview
- Shape where this goes
