## Technical Production Notes

### Style Guide

**Color Palette:**
```
Background: hsl(32 20% 95%) - Warm cream
Primary: hsl(157 31% 40%) - Forest green
Accents: hsl(32 40% 85%) - Warm neutral
Text: hsl(32 10% 20%) - Dark brown-black

```

**Typography:**

- Weights: 400, 600, 800

**Animation Principles:**
1. Ease-in-out for all transitions (no linear)

4. Nothing jarring or hyperactive

6. Subtle motion - calm, not frenetic

**Illustration Style:**
- 2D flat design with subtle depth (soft shadows)
- Rounded corners on everything (12-16px radius)
- Minimalist icons, high recognition
- Human silhouettes (abstract, inclusive)
- Warm, inviting, Scandinavian aesthetic
- Not corporate - friendly and capable

## Voiceover Direction

**Voice Profile:**
- Gender: Neutral to warm female voice
- Age: 30-45 sound
- Accent: Neutral American (slight warmth)
- Tone: Confident but not corporate, capable but not pushy
- Pacing: Measured, clear, not rushed
- Emotion: Understanding, reassuring, honest

**Specific Direction:**
- Opening: Acknowledge the frustration (empathetic)
- Product intro: Confident, clear (this is the solution)
- Feature descriptions: Warm, helpful (here's how it works)
- Beta CTA: Inviting, not pushy (join us)
- Timeline teaser: Exciting but honest (coming soon)

**Full Script:**
```
"You have the information somewhere...

Symphony OS. Your family's command center.

Everything you need, right when you need it. No searching.

Plan your week. Spot conflicts. Fix them before they're chaos.

Everyone knows who's doing what. Fair, visible, clear.

```

**Avoid:**

**Sound Design:**
- UI sounds: Soft, tactile, satisfying
- No harsh beeps or alerts
- Natural soundscapes (coffee shop, home)
- Everything supports the calm aesthetic
- Reference: Things 3, Headspace sounds

**Mix:**

## Key Differences from Original Concept

**What Changed:**
- ❌ Removed: AI meal planning (not built)
- ❌ Removed: Timeline Companion as hero (not ready)
- ✅ Added: Context attachments as hero (what works now)
- ✅ Added: Planning mode prominence (visual, ready)
- ✅ Added: Beta honesty throughout
- ✅ Changed: Timeline as optional teaser at end

**Why This Works Better:**
1. **Honest:** Shows what actually works
2. **Focused:** One clear hero moment (context)
3. **Shorter:** 45s instead of 60s (better retention)
4. **Realistic:** Sets proper expectations for beta
5. **Teaser:** Timeline creates curiosity without overpromising

---

## Closing Notes

**What Makes This Effective:**

1. **Leads with pain** - The chaos opening is instantly relatable
2. **Hero feature is clear** - Context attachments solve the real problem
3. **Visual but honest** - Planning mode is beautiful AND ready
4. **Creates desire** - Timeline teaser makes beta exciting
5. **Sets expectations** - Beta CTA is honest about stage

**What to Avoid:**

- Don't oversell unfinished features
- Don't make it look too perfect (some beta roughness is okay)
- Don't promise Timeline is "ready now"
- Don't mention AI capabilities that don't exist
- Don't pretend it's more than it is

**The Goal:**

Make someone watching on their phone during a chaotic morning think: *"Wait, that actually solves my problem. And it works NOW. I should try the beta."*

Then make it easy for them to sign up.
