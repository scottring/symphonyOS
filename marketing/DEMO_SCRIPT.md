## PART 1: The Problem (90 seconds)

**[Screen: Blank/neutral slide or desktop]**

"Let me show you a typical Monday morning in my house..."

**[Open multiple tabs/apps chaotically]**
- Google Calendar
- Notion
- Reminders
- Email with recipe
- Text thread with wife about dinner

"Sound familiar? Tasks in one place, events in another, that recipe you saved somewhere, the kids' schedule... and you're the only one who knows where it all is."

"The mental load isn't just about HAVING things to do—it's about FINDING the information when you need it."

**[Close all tabs]**

"What if there was one system that actually understood how families work?"

---

## PART 2: First Impression (60 seconds)

**[Open Symphony OS - Home view]**

*Pause for 3 seconds—let the calm, clean interface land*

"This is Symphony OS. Your family's operating system."

**[Gesture to interface sections]**

"Here's what you see when you open it:"
- "Today's schedule—color-coded by who it's for"
- "Timeline showing when everyone needs to be where"
- "Context cards for what's happening now and next"
- "Quick access to projects, routines, and pins"

"Notice what you DON'T see: No overwhelming walls of text. No notification badges screaming at you. Just what matters right now."

---

## PART 3: Core Demo Flow (8-10 minutes)

### 3.1: Quick Capture (90 seconds)

**[Show it in calendar and as task card]**

"See? One system, flexible to how you actually work."

---

### 3.2: The Today View & Context (2 minutes)

**[Navigate to Today view with several items]**

"This is where Symphony shines. It's not about showing you EVERYTHING—it's about showing you what matters RIGHT NOW."

**[Click on "Call dentist" task]**

**[Detail panel opens on right with:**

**[Point to phone number]**
"One tap to call."

**[Point to notes]**
"My questions are right here—no scrambling to remember."

**[Point to prep task]**
"And it reminded me to check insurance BEFORE calling."

**[Close detail panel]**

"This is the difference between a task manager and an operating system. Context when you need it."

"Ella has soccer until 5:30..."

**[Point to Scott's meeting]**
"And I have a meeting until 5:45."

**[Gesture to the conflict]**
"Symphony spots this BEFORE it's a problem. We need dinner ready by 6, but nobody's home until 5:45? Either we're eating late or we need a plan."

**[Show detail panel with prep tasks]**
"So I set up prep tasks: slow cooker meal, start it before work. Problem solved."

"This is how families actually coordinate. Visual, intuitive, and it shows conflicts before they become chaos."

## PART 4: The Difference It Makes (90 seconds)

**[Return to desktop home view]**

"So what does this actually mean for your family?"

**[Point to different areas of screen as you speak]**

"**You stop being the family database.**
Your partner can look up the dentist's number themselves. Kids can check their schedule. You're not the bottleneck."

"**Conflicts get spotted before they're crises.**
That Timeline Companion shows you Thursday's chaos on Sunday, when you can still fix it."

"**Context travels with every task.**
No more 'where's that link?' or 'what was I supposed to ask them?' Everything's attached."

"**Planning becomes enjoyable.**
Sunday evening brain dump with coffee becomes your weekly reset, not a source of stress."

"**Fair assignment actually happens.**
You can SEE who's doing what. No more invisible labor or arguments about balance."

**[Pause]**

"Symphony doesn't eliminate work. But it eliminates the CHAOS around work."

- **Don't rush the context reveal** - When that detail panel opens with everything attached, pause
- **Make AI meal planning feel magical** - The prompt → full meal plan should feel effortless
- **Keep project management brief** - Show the value but don't get lost in task details
- **End on emotion** - The "difference it makes" section should feel human, not feature-listy
