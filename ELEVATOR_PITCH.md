# Symphony OS: Elevator Pitches

*Quick reference for explaining what Symphony is — choose based on audience and context*

---

## 30-Second Version (Networking)

"Symphony is your WHOLE Life Operating System — designed for adults managing hectic lives across work, personal, and family.

Symphony does three things beautifully: First, it connects tasks to people, because life is collaborative. Second, it makes context first-class — phone numbers, links, notes attach to tasks and surface when you need them. Third, it brings the right information forward at the right time.

You plan deeply when you have time to think. Symphony makes sure everything you attached shows up exactly when you need it."

## 60-Second Version (Coffee Chat)

"Symphony is a personal OS for organizing work, life, and family. Most productivity apps are either work-focused or family-focused, but my life happens in three contexts: professional projects, personal goals, and household management.

The real innovation is context surfacing. When I plan my week, I attach everything I'll need to tasks: vendor phone numbers, product links, measurement notes. Then when it's time to order that tile or call that contractor, I tap the task and everything is right there. I set it up once, Symphony surfaces it every time.

It's built single-user first — my work stays private, my personal projects stay private. But family sharing is robust. My wife and I can assign household tasks to each other, plan our week together on Sundays, and each see our own view.

I plan deeply on desktop when I have time to think. I capture and execute on mobile when life happens. That's Symphony."

## 2-Minute Version (Demo/Pitch)

"Let me show you what Symphony does.

Picture this: It's 2pm Wednesday. You need to order tile for your kitchen remodel. You open Symphony and there it is — the task with everything you need attached.

**Symphony makes context first-class.**

When you create a task, you attach everything you'll need:
- The product link
- The contractor's phone number
- Your notes: 'Arctic White subway tile, 3x6, 45 sq ft'
- Photo of the kitchen

You set this up once during your weekly planning session on desktop — that's when you have time to think and organize.

Then on mobile, when it's time to act, you tap 'Order backsplash tile' and everything is there:
- Tap the link → Opens product page
- Tap the number → Calls contractor
- See your notes → Remember exactly what you need
- One-tap mark done → Task disappears

That's the core value: **set it up once, surfaces every time.**

Your life happens in three domains, and Symphony treats all three equally:

1. **Work** — Client calls, project deadlines, professional tasks
2. **Personal** — Health goals, hobbies, learning projects
3. **Family** — Household tasks, kids' schedules, home projects

You can filter by domain. Set working hours where only work shows. Have family tasks surface in the evening.

**Symphony is built for individuals with robust sharing.**

You are the primary user. Your work stays private. Your personal goals stay private. When you share family tasks with your partner, that sharing works beautifully:
- Create tasks in the family domain
- Assign to your partner
- They see it in their view with full context
- Sunday planning sessions together

Think of it as: **Your personal OS with multiplayer mode** — not a family app with private folders.

The philosophy is **plan on desktop, execute on mobile:**
- Desktop: Weekly brain dump, process inbox, add rich context, deep planning
- Mobile: Quick capture, see today's cards, tap to act, mark done

Symphony is in private beta now. We're focused on getting the core loop perfect: capture → plan → execute → sync. If this resonates, I'd love to get your feedback."

## One-Liner Variants

**Casual:** "It's like a personal OS for work, life, and family that actually remembers the stuff you need when you need it."

**Technical:** "Context-aware task management with domain separation and robust sharing primitives."

**Investor:** "Personal operating system for life organization with intelligent context surfacing and first-class multi-user support."

**Problem-focused:** "Ever spend 10 minutes hunting for that link, that number, those notes you saved somewhere? We fix that."

**Outcome-focused:** "Plan your week once. Symphony makes sure everything you need shows up exactly when you need it."

## Response to Common Questions

### "How is this different from [Todoist/Things/Asana/Notion/etc]?"

"Great question. Symphony does three unique things:

First, it treats work, personal, and family as equal domains — your whole life, not just one part of it.

Second, it makes context first-class. A task in Symphony is a container: links, phone numbers, notes, files. When it's time to act, everything surfaces together. You set it up once during planning, it delivers reliably every time.

Third, it's built for individuals with robust sharing — not a team tool adapted for personal use, and not a family app that treats you as secondary to the household."

### "Isn't this just another to-do app?"

"Symphony does something fundamentally different.

It stores **context,** not just tasks. The task title is just the handle. The value is in everything you attach to it — and how Symphony surfaces that context when you need it.

Symphony handles three domains — work AND personal AND family — with privacy controls for each.

And it's designed around how you actually live: Desktop for deep planning when you have time. Mobile for quick execution when you're in the moment."

### "Why not just use [Notion/Obsidian/Apple Notes] for this?"

"Notes apps are excellent for reference. Symphony is designed for execution.

Symphony surfaces information automatically based on your schedule and context. When it's time to make that call or place that order, Symphony brings everything forward. You don't have to remember to look — it's already there."

### "What about privacy? Do you sell data?"

"No. Never.

Symphony is built for individuals, so your data is fundamentally private. Your work tasks, personal goals — no one sees those except you.

If you choose to share family tasks with your household, that's your choice. But we never sell or share your data with third parties. Period."

## Target Audiences

### Primary: Professional + Family (You)
"You have a demanding job, a family, and personal goals. You need one system that handles all three without compromising any of them."

### Secondary: Busy Parents (Iris-type users)
"You manage household logistics, kids' schedules, and home projects. You need robust tools, not dumbed-down 'family organizers.'"

### Tertiary: Solopreneurs / Side-hustlers
"You blur the lines between personal and professional. You need domain separation without multiple apps."

## The Three Core Benefits (Positive Framing)

For adults managing hectic lives across work, family, and personal domains:

### 1. **Life is Collaborative — Symphony Connects Tasks to People**

Your to-dos involve others: family members sharing responsibilities, contractors you need to call, doctors you schedule with, coworkers you collaborate with.

**Symphony enables:**
- Tag people involved in tasks
- Assign family tasks to household members
- Everyone sees what they're responsible for
- Nothing falls through the cracks

**Benefit:** Clear coordination, shared understanding, seamless collaboration.

### 2. **Context Enables Execution — Symphony Makes It First-Class**

Executing a task requires more than a title. You need: phone numbers to call, product links to order from, measurements you took, notes about decisions you made.

**Symphony enables:**
- Attach phone numbers, links, notes, files during planning
- Everything surfaces together when it's time to act
- Set it up once, Symphony brings it forward every time
- No searching across apps, no "where did I save that?"

**Benefit:** Effortless execution. Everything you need, right when you need it.

### 3. **The Right Time Matters — Symphony Brings Information Forward**

You plan deeply when you have time — Sunday morning, coffee in hand, thinking through your week. You attach context, schedule tasks, organize projects.

**Symphony enables:**
- Planning that builds execution context
- Mobile UI that surfaces what you attached
- Information appears automatically based on your schedule
- Desktop for planning, mobile for execution

**Benefit:** The planning you do shows up exactly when you need it. Zero friction.
