# Symphony OS: Elevator Pitches

*Quick reference for explaining what Symphony is — choose based on audience and context*

## 30-Second Version (Networking)

"Symphony is your WHOLE Life Operating System — designed for adults managing complex lives across work, personal, family, and house and home.

Symphony does three things beautifully: First, it's built to collaborate from the very beginning — connecting tasks to people is core functionality, not a tack-on. Second, it makes context first-class — phone numbers, links, notes attach to tasks and surface when you need them. No more searching through emails and attachments and spreadsheets for that one piece of information. Third, it's for your whole life — work, personal, family, house and home all equally important.

You plan deeply when you have time to think. Symphony makes sure everything you attached shows up exactly when you need it."

## 60-Second Version (Coffee Chat)

"Symphony is a personal OS for organizing your whole life — work, personal, family, house and home. Most productivity apps are either work-focused or family-focused, but my life happens across all these contexts.

The real innovation is context surfacing. When I plan my week, I attach everything I'll need to tasks: vendor phone numbers, product links, measurement notes. Then when it's time to order that tile or call that contractor, I tap the task and everything is right there. No more searching through emails and attachments and spreadsheets for that one piece of information. I set it up once, Symphony surfaces it every time.

It's built for individuals, designed for sharing. My work stays private, my personal projects stay private. But family sharing is robust — built in from the beginning, not tacked on. My wife and I can assign household tasks to each other, plan our week together on Sundays, and each see our own view.

I plan deeply on desktop when I have time to think. I capture and execute on mobile when life happens. That's Symphony."

## 2-Minute Version (Demo/Pitch)

"Let me show you what Symphony does.

Picture this: It's 2pm Wednesday. You need to order tile for your kitchen remodel. You open Symphony and there it is — the task with everything you need attached.

**Symphony makes context first-class.**

When you create a task, you attach everything you'll need:
- The product link
- The contractor's phone number
- Your notes: 'Arctic White subway tile, 3x6, 45 sq ft'
- Photo of the kitchen

You set this up once during your weekly planning session on desktop — that's when you have time to think and organize.

Then on mobile, when it's time to act, you tap 'Order backsplash tile' and everything is there:
- Tap the link → Opens product page
- Tap the number → Calls contractor
- See your notes → Remember exactly what you need
- One-tap mark done → Task disappears

That's the core value: **set it up once, surfaces every time.**

Your life happens across multiple contexts, and Symphony treats all of them equally:

1. **Work** — Client calls, project deadlines, professional tasks
2. **Personal** — Health goals, hobbies, learning projects
3. **Family** — Household tasks, kids' schedules, coordinating with partner
4. **House and Home** — Repairs, renovations, maintenance projects

You can filter by context. Set working hours where only work shows. Have family and home tasks surface in the evening.

**Symphony is built for individuals with robust sharing.**

You are the primary user. Your work stays private. Your personal goals stay private. When you share family tasks with your partner, that sharing works beautifully:
- Create tasks in the family domain
- Assign to your partner
- They see it in their view with full context
- Sunday planning sessions together

Think of it as: **Your personal OS with multiplayer mode** — not a family app with private folders.

The philosophy is **plan on desktop, execute on mobile:**
- Desktop: Weekly brain dump, process inbox, add rich context, deep planning
- Mobile: Quick capture, see today's cards, tap to act, mark done

Symphony is in private beta now. We're focused on getting the core loop perfect: capture → plan → execute → sync. If this resonates, I'd love to get your feedback."

## One-Liner Variants

**Casual:** "It's like a personal OS for work, life, and family that actually remembers the stuff you need when you need it."

**Technical:** "Context-aware task management with domain separation and robust sharing primitives."

**Investor:** "Personal operating system for life organization with intelligent context surfacing and first-class multi-user support."

**Problem-focused:** "Ever spend 10 minutes hunting for that link, that number, those notes you saved somewhere? We fix that."

**Outcome-focused:** "Plan your week once. Symphony makes sure everything you need shows up exactly when you need it."

## Response to Common Questions

### "How is this different from [Todoist/Things/Asana/Notion/etc]?"

"Great question. Symphony does three unique things:

First, it's built to collaborate from the very beginning — not a tack-on feature. Connecting tasks to people, assigning to family members, sharing context — it's core functionality.

Second, it makes context first-class. A task in Symphony is a container: links, phone numbers, notes, files. When it's time to act, everything surfaces together. No more searching through emails and attachments and spreadsheets for that one piece of information. You set it up once during planning, it delivers reliably every time.

Third, it's for your whole life — work, personal, family, house and home all equally important. Not a team tool adapted for personal use, and not a family app that treats you as secondary to the household. Built for individuals, designed for sharing."

### "Isn't this just another to-do app?"

"Symphony does something fundamentally different.

It stores **context,** not just tasks. The task title is just the handle. The value is in everything you attach to it — and how Symphony surfaces that context when you need it. No more searching through emails and attachments and spreadsheets for that one piece of information.

Symphony handles your whole life — work AND personal AND family AND house and home — with privacy controls for each.

And it's designed around how you actually live: Desktop for deep planning when you have time. Mobile for quick execution when you're in the moment."

### "Why not just use [Notion/Obsidian/Apple Notes] for this?"

"Notes apps are excellent for reference. Symphony is designed for execution.

Symphony surfaces information automatically based on your schedule and context. When it's time to make that call or place that order, Symphony brings everything forward. You don't have to remember to look — it's already there."

### "What about privacy? Do you sell data?"

"No. Never.

Symphony is built for individuals, so your data is fundamentally private. Your work tasks, personal goals — no one sees those except you.

If you choose to share family tasks with your household, that's your choice. But we never sell or share your data with third parties. Period."

## Target Audiences

### Primary: Professional + Family (You)
"You have a demanding job, a family, personal goals, and home projects. You need one system that handles all of them without compromising any."

### Secondary: Busy Parents (Iris-type users)
"You manage household logistics, kids' schedules, home projects, and your own work. You need robust tools, not dumbed-down 'family organizers.'"

### Tertiary: Solopreneurs / Side-hustlers
"You blur the lines between personal and professional. You need domain separation without multiple apps."

## The Three Core Benefits (Positive Framing)

For adults managing complex lives across work, personal, family, and house and home:

### 1. **Built to Collaborate from the Beginning**

Collaboration isn't a tack-on feature — it's core to how Symphony works. Your to-dos involve others: family members sharing responsibilities, contractors you need to call, doctors you schedule with, coworkers you collaborate with.

**Symphony enables:**
- Tag people involved in tasks
- Assign family tasks to household members
- Everyone sees what they're responsible for
- Robust sharing built in from day one

**Benefit:** Clear coordination, shared understanding, seamless collaboration.

### 2. **Context is First-Class**

Executing a task requires more than a title. You need: phone numbers to call, product links to order from, measurements you took, notes about decisions you made. No more searching through emails and attachments and spreadsheets for that one piece of information.

**Symphony enables:**
- Attach phone numbers, links, notes, files during planning
- Everything surfaces together when it's time to act
- Set it up once, Symphony brings it forward every time
- Zero searching, just execution

**Benefit:** Effortless execution. Everything you need, right when you need it.

### 3. **Your Whole Life**

Work, personal, family, house and home — all equally important. Most apps force you to choose between work productivity or family coordination. Symphony handles all contexts with equal importance.

**Symphony enables:**
- Unified view of your entire life
- Filter by context when you need focus
- Desktop for deep planning, mobile for execution
- Built for individuals, designed for sharing

**Benefit:** One system for everything. No more juggling multiple apps.
