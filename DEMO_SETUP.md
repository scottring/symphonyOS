## Demo Script (7 minutes)

### Opening (30 sec)

**You:** "Let me show you what makes Symphony different. This is Alex Chen—consultant with 2 kids, managing work, family, and a kitchen renovation. Watch how Symphony handles all three contexts."

**Action:** Show **Universal view** (🌐) - full timeline with calendar events + demo data visible

---

### Act 1: Domain Switching (1 min)

**You:** "Symphony has something no other app does: **domain switching.** Watch what happens when I tap these domains."

**Actions:**
1. **Tap 💼 Work domain**
   - Timeline transforms
   - Only shows: 9am Client call
   - Say: "This is my Work view. Perfect for client screen shares—zero family logistics visible."

2. **Tap 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family domain**
   - Shows: 6:30pm Dinner event
   - Say: "Switch to Family—household coordination only. My work client names? Totally private."

3. **Tap 🌱 Personal domain**
   - Shows: Kitchen Renovation project
   - Say: "Personal domain: home projects. Private from both work AND family."

4. **Tap 🌐 Universal**
   - Everything returns
   - Say: "Universal is my command center for full-picture planning."

**Key message:** "Not just tags. The entire app transforms based on your life context."

---

### Act 2: Brain Dump + Live Triage (3 min)

**You:** "It's Monday morning. Let me capture what's in my head before my 9am call."

**Stay in Universal view for this**

#### Brain Dump (30 sec)
Use QuickCapture FAB to add these 5 tasks:

1. "Pick up Michael from soccer at 6" → Enter
2. "Pick up Jane from climbing at 6" → Enter
3. "Call contractor about tile delay" → Enter
4. "Order cabinet hardware" → Enter
5. "Send Acme proposal draft" → Enter

**Point out:** "All land in inbox. Zero friction—just brain to screen."

#### Triage (2.5 min)

**You:** "Now 2 minutes of organization. Watch how domains and context work together."

**For each task, use the inline triage icons (📅 🏷️ 👤):**

1. **"Send Acme proposal draft"**
   - 📅 → Today 2:00pm
   - Already tagged 💼 Work (auto-detected)
   - **Point out:** "Auto-tagged as Work. Tap to open..."
   - Open task → Add link to Google Doc (fake URL is fine)
   - **Say:** "When it's 2pm, this link surfaces automatically."

2. **"Order cabinet hardware"**
   - 📅 → Today 3:00pm
   - Already tagged 🌱 Personal (inherited from Kitchen Renovation project!)
   - Open task → Show context inherited from project
   - **Point out:** "It's already linked to Kitchen Renovation. The contractor's phone number, supplier link, all my notes—inherited automatically. I set that up once, Symphony brings it forward every time."

3. **"Call contractor about tile delay"**
   - 📅 → Today 4:00pm
   - Also 🌱 Personal
   - Open → Show phone number inherited from Kitchen Renovation project
   - **Say:** "Tap-to-call number, right there. No searching."

4. **"Pick up Michael from soccer at 6"**
   - 📅 → Today 6:00pm
   - 🏷️ → Family
   - 👤 → Michael (shows contact picker)
   - Open → Add address: "Riverside Fields, 123 Oak St"

5. **"Pick up Jane from climbing at 6"**
   - 📅 → Today 6:00pm
   - 🏷️ → Family
   - Open → Add address: "Summit Climbing Gym, 456 Maple Ave"
   - **Point out:** "Wait—two 6pm pickups!"
   - 👤 → Assign to Iris
   - **Say:** "Iris will see this in HER Family domain view. Problem solved."

**After triaging:** "5 minutes of planning. Now watch execution."

---

### Act 3: Domain-Filtered Mobile Execution (2 min)

**Switch to mobile view or simulate**

**You:** "It's 2pm. I'm working. Look at my timeline in Work domain..."

**Actions:**
1. **Switch to 💼 Work domain** (if not already)
   - Shows: 2pm "Send Acme proposal draft"
   - **Tap task** → Link appears
   - **Say:** "Tap link, opens doc, I send it. Mark done." ✓

2. **Switch to 🌐 Universal** (to see next tasks)
   - Shows: 3pm Order hardware, 4pm Call contractor
   - **Say:** "But in Work domain, these Personal tasks don't distract me. Symphony respects my focus."

3. **Time jump to 3pm, tap "Order cabinet hardware"**
   - Shows:
     - Vendor link (inherited from project)
     - Measurements from project notes
     - Related to: Kitchen Renovation
   - **Say:** "Everything I need, right here. I set this up this morning. No searching, no switching apps, no hunting through emails."

4. **4pm: Tap "Call contractor"**
   - Phone number appears with tap-to-call
   - **Say:** "One tap. Add note about what they say..."
   - Add quick note: "Tile delayed 2 weeks, arriving March 15"
   - **Show:** "This note saves to the Kitchen Renovation project automatically."

5. **Switch to 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family domain at 6pm**
   - Only see: "Pick up Michael from soccer" (Jane's assigned to Iris)
   - Address shows: "Riverside Fields, 123 Oak St"
   - Tap for navigation
   - **Say:** "Iris sees Jane's pickup in her view. I see Michael's. We planned together, now we execute our own assignments."

### Closing (30 sec)

**You:** "That's Symphony. Three game-changers:

**1. Domain switching** → Entire app adapts to your life context. Work stays private, family coordination stays separate, personal goals invisible to both.

**2. Context surfacing** → I planned for 5 minutes, attached everything I'd need. During execution, Symphony surfaces it exactly when I need it. Set it up once, it delivers every time.

**3. Built for individuals, designed for sharing** → Iris has her own account, her own work, her own view. But family coordination? Robust, first-class, built in from day one.

Desktop for deep planning. Mobile for quick execution. Your whole life, four views. That's Symphony."

## Tips for Success

### Preparation
- [ ] Reset demo data 5 minutes before presentation
- [ ] Verify calendar events are visible in Symphony
- [ ] Set domain to Universal view
- [ ] Clear any personal data if using shared account
- [ ] Have fake Google Doc link ready for "Acme proposal" task

### During Demo
- **Speak slowly** when showing domain switching—let the UI transformation register
- **Pause after context surfacing moments** - "See? Everything right here."
- **Show, don't tell** - Let the UI speak for itself
- **Use real gestures** - Actually tap, don't just point
- **Acknowledge questions** but redirect: "Great question—let's finish the flow and I'll circle back"

### Common Questions
**Q: "How is this different from Notion/Todoist?"**
A: "Two things: Domain switching transforms the entire app—not just filtering. And context surfaces automatically at execution time, not just stored in notes."

**Q: "Does my partner need an account?"**
A: "For full features, yes. But you can assign tasks to family members even without accounts—they're just names in your system."

**Q: "What if I forget to switch domains?"**
A: "Universal view shows everything. And untagged items show in all domains until you triage them. You can't 'lose' anything."

## Post-Demo Reset

After demo completes:
1. Settings → Admin → Reset Demo
2. Clears all demo tasks created during live demo
3. Reloads fresh state for next presentation

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Calendar events don't show
**Fix:** Check calendar is connected and domain-assigned in Settings → Calendar

**Issue:** Tasks don't auto-tag correctly
**Fix:** Ensure project has `context` field set, tasks inherit from it

**Issue:** Demo data missing after reset
**Fix:** Check console for errors, verify Supabase connection

**Issue:** Domain switching not working
**Fix:** Hard refresh page (Cmd+Shift+R), check DomainProvider wraps app
