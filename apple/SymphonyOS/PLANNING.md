# Planning on the iPhone app

The phone follows the web's one-enduring-action model
(`supabase/migrations/2026-09-21_one_enduring_action.sql` on main).

## What it reads

| Question | Source |
|---|---|
| Which week/month/season holds a task | `task_commitments` (status `open`/`done`); a task with none falls back to the `tasks` cache (`bucket` + `week_start`/`month_start`/`season_start`) |
| Chosen for my day | my own `task_focus` row; `tasks.planned_on` only when a task has no focus rows |
| Routine due on a date | `RoutineRules` — a port of `matchesRecurrenceForDate` + `resolveRoutine` |
| Routine chosen for a date | `actionable_instances.planned_on` |
| Seasons | `households.seasons`, else Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec 1 |
| Year goals | `goals` |

Weeks start on **Sunday**, as the database triggers do.

## What it writes (`Services/Planning/PlanWriter.swift`)

- **Today**: `bucket='timed'`, `scheduled_for` = midnight, `is_all_day`, plus my `task_focus` row.
- **A week task onto a day**: the same, with no commitment change, so the week stays open.
- **This week**: `bucket='week'`, `week_start`, and an open `week` commitment.
- **Someday**: every open commitment → `removed`, then `bucket='someday'`.
- **Review**:
  - Keep: old commitment → `carried`, plus a new open commitment.
  - Drop: that week's commitment → `removed`.
  - Done: complete the task.
- **Choose a routine occurrence**: `planned_on` on that day's instance. For a flexible weekly routine it also sets `deferred_to` to local noon. The routine row is never written.

Period stamps are pushed only after a placement change (`placementDirty`). So an ordinary edit never nulls a placement made on the web.

## Reviewing on the simulator

In a Debug build, launching with `-SymphonyDemo` gives you:
- an in-memory store with sample data;
- a local stand-in user;
- no sync.

`SymphonyOSUITests/PlannerScreensUITests` walks every screen with this data, at default and accessibility text sizes. It saves screenshots to `$TEST_RUNNER_SCREENSHOT_DIR`.
